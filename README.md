# XML Parser
In this repository, I access XML code on the webpage by parsing a text string
into an XML DOM object and reading the info with javascript. When this XML DOM
object is obtained, we bring in  the `documentElement` ; this gets a reference
to the root node of the element. We chain it to the XML DOM object and then we 
can use it to traverse the DOM.

The index.html file will be  used to display the information on the web page
